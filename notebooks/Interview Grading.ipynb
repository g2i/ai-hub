Uh, we are now recording. So the first question that I have for you is this, right? Mm-hmm. So I have here this get active users with cat function. This function, it, it's taking, uh, a set of users. So each user, it's, it's represented by an object. Each object, um, has name, is active, and has cat as properties, right? Okay. So the idea is that we can return the correct set of users, uh, but with these two conditions: the users needs, needs to be active and also has a cat. Those two conditions. Okay? Okay. Okay? Good. So you can- All right. So (clears throat) this, uh, we're gonna use the filter, uh, method from the array. Mm-hmm. Uh, so we're gonna get a user and we're gonna filter only the ones that is active and user as cat. So I think this should do it. Yeah. Yeah, you should do it. Awesome. That was pretty fast. Great. Okay. Awesome. Let, let's keep going. All right. In th- in this case, we have this create new user. Uh, don't worry, you don't have to implement anything here. Uh, I just want you to tell me two things. The first one is, tell me what type or, or what kind of argument is that function taking? And the second thing is, explain the different syntaxes we have here. For example, this equal sign and this triple dots. Okay? Okay. Um, so this function is taking an object as an argument, and it's, uh, destructuring. Um, and it's using this equals some name here, this is, uh, uh, a default value. If name is undefined, it will assign this, uh, uh, value to that property, and active that, that can be, uh, undefined. We're n- we're not doing anything with this. And this is spreading the rest of the properties of the object on the argument. Awesome. Good. All right. So let's keep, let's keep going. All right, uh, in this case, we have this person class, which is a very simple class, right? And in line number nine, what we are doing is trying to instantiate a new object of that class. For that reason, we are parsing this name and this age. The question is, what is missing inside the class to be able to instantiate this object properly? Uh, it's missing the constructor for this class, um, on JavaScript you need to provide this constructor function- Yeah. ... to initialize it. Otherwise, it will use the default one that you have in there, which is an empty string and a H as zero. Yeah, that's correct. Good. Awesome. All right. All right, in this, in this, uh, piece of code, what we have here is we are trying to, to, to create a, a sync functionality, right? Uh, if we run this code, uh, it will print start, finish, and timeout. That's wrong. The correct order- Yeah. ... would, the correct order would be start, timeout, and finish. The idea is that you can fix the order, but you have to use promises. That's the only condition, using promises. Okay. Uh, so the first thing is that we need to return a promise in here, uh, let's just do... We're gonna return new promise, and if I'm not mistaken, there's this reject and resolve. Um, and then console log, and then we gotta resolve it. I think this, this, this is going to work now. If you, if you want start, timeout, and finish. Yeah, it will do it. Great. That's great. Cool. Okay. Let, let's keep going. Let's continue to the next line. (clears throat) Good. All right. In this case, we have this implementation, which is based on JavaScript objects, right? Uh, here we have this old object that has contact and email, and has this old email value assign- assigned to it. In line number 10, what we are trying to do is create a new object based on the old object. For that reason, we are spreading the old object inside it. Mm-hmm. In this line, what we are trying to do is change the new object contact email value to this new email value. Okay? The question is, what are these console logs printing and explain why? Um, both are going to print new email, um, I think, um, i- it does because the objects get copied by reference, um, in JavaScript.So this ob- this o- object will copy, uh, this one but then the contact, it will still be the same 'cause it's another object. So I think it will print new email, um, but I might say I'm not completely sure because of this nested object, but I'm pretty sure it will keep the reference to this object. Okay, so you say both of them are going to print new email, right? Yeah. Good. That's my answer, (laughs) Awesome. That's good. All right, (clears throat) so okay, good. Mm, do you know what- what is an event emitter? And just give me an example of one of them or- or a library that we can use for- to use event emitters. Yeah, basically they're just, um, they're like, uh, an object that emit events (laughs) that's kind of, like, redundant, but it basically works that you attach listeners to this emitter, um, and once the emitter sends an event, all those attached listeners will get fired with the event. Um, we can find those on the DOM, for example, when you attach, uh, an event listener to a HTML button, you can- Mm-hmm. ... use the add event listener multiple times, and that's- that's kind of like a- an emitter. So when you- Okay. ... click it, for example, you can- Okay, uh- ... receive that event. ... Do you know any- any example on- on the Node side? Um, I think, uh, Node has a- a- a package built in it called Emitter. I- I don't remember exactly, I haven't used it, uh, in a long time. Okay. But- but yeah, they're- they- they- they are packages on NPM, uh, that you can use also, uh, to handle event emitters. Okay, good. Um, do you know why was arrow functions introduced into JavaScript? Um, if I can remember, it was because, um, one thing was the- the scope of the, this- Mm-hmm. ... uh, keyword on JavaScript. So every time you- Okay. ... created a function, uh, you were changing the scope of the this, uh, keyword. So with, uh, fat arrows, uh, it doesn't change the context, so- Mm-hmm. ... it keeps the- the parent function context, so that was one. And I think it... because one-liner functions (laughs) look, uh, a lot better. (laughs) Okay. Okay, awesome. Uh, in- in NodeJS, how do you debug a, an application in the- in development environment? Uh, you create it, uh, you start the application in debug mode, and you can connect to it through Chrome, uh- Mm-hmm. ... to the- the debugger, the Node debugger basically, and you can see it kind of like it was JavaScript on the web, uh, but it's through Chrome. Yeah, awesome. All right, uh, let me put this piece of code here again. Um, okay, here we have this- this- Mm-hmm. ... function, right? I just want you to tell me what happens when this express route handler gets- gets called. Yeah, um, so line eight, you declare a content route from the express app, and then you try to read the file, and that is on the same directory of that file, and then you- Okay. ... append the content, that JSON, so you're trying to read content JSON on the same directory, basically. Um, once you get the data, uh, uh, it runs code that throws an error, so that's an- that's not good. I think we need to check if there is an error, um, present, then we throw the error, and if it's not, uh, we can send the data on the response object. The other thing is that this try-catch is not going to do, I think, a lot, because you're using the callback, uh, mode for the filesystem module. Um, but yeah, it's basically trying to send the content JSON, uh, content back to the client. Okay, so what- what you're saying is that- is that this try-catch does not catch the error? No, it will not catch the error- Okay. ... if an error occur. Okay. Awesome. Uh, okay, good. (clears throat) So here's a NodeJS, uh, case. Um, we- we were requested to implement an endpoint that would return an, uh, stream of video content, right? The question is- Mm-hmm. ... how this can be implemented in NodeJS, and what APIs would you use to achieve this, and what things you need to- to watch out for?Yeah, uh, the first thing is, to watch out is for this header. I think all of the browsers in this header when they try to access media on the server, which is the range header, so we need to- Mm-hmm. ... watch for that. After we have that one, um, uh, we need to... Basically they ask us for a range of bytes on a, on a file. So when we read, we, we need to parse that range and we need to figure out, uh, the file size and, and then we need to read that file but at specific, at the specific range that the browser is asking for, so we don't read the whole file. So it goes into how you call it, like, uh, like in a streaming mode. We gotta handle the correct HTTP codes, which is partial content, if I, uh, remember correctly. Uh, so we wanna keep the connection open there. Um, and I think, yeah, there's a couple of other headers that we need to send back, which I don't remember exactly, but basically you need to specify, uh- Okay. ... what's the size of the file. That kind of stuff. Awesome. Sounds good. All right. Uh, okay, give me one second. My computer is lagging. (laughs) Oh, Jesus. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Here we go. So here we have this piece of code. Right? Mm, the question is, uh, can you write a synchronous code inside the uncaught exception even called back and explain why yes or not. Hmm. Damn, that's a good one. Um, I don't think you can. Uh, I will assume because that's just the end of the... well, when it's a, an exception. Mm-hmm. I would assume not, but I'm not exactly why not. I haven't encountered this in the past, so, but I will say no, you cannot. Um, I've never seen it before. (laughs) Okay. Um, but yeah, I, I don't know exactly why not. And I, I'm probably wrong, but I will go with that one. Okay. You say you cannot write code, but you don't know the reason why. (laughs) Yeah, I don't, I don't- Okay. ... think you can, you should write asynchronous code on this function. Uh, I don't know, probably can generate more codes. Um, more, more errors, uh, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. Okay. It's good. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right, give me one second. I have to open something here. My computer is really, really... Okay, good. Here we go. Uh, here we have a, a graph, right? But that it represent, it's representing a, a, a traffic pattern in a server, right? Mm-hmm. Uh, the question is, mm, how do you provision a server to handle these arbitrary large peaks in that server? Hmm, what's, what does it say? Pace dock and then edit? Yeah, that's, that's basically the, the, the traffic pattern. Um, uh, it's, it's, it's not relevant, the, the pace docks or edits, it's just, yeah, it has some arbitrary peaks on some actions, but on some other actions it's behaving like expected, right? Um, I will... There's probably some, uh, database, right? Or a lot of... uh, oh, it's mostly certain that it has to either with the database rights and reads that, that, uh, route it's handling or if it's that I will s- I will, I will go with trying to optimize the query. Um... Okay. The other thing that I can think of, it's probably, um, third party appli- uh, apps that we're using that they can be, uh, I don't know, taking a lot of time to resolve. Yeah. And the last thing I can, can, that I will debug, uh, would be that if we're, uh, making expensive tasks on that controller, and then we need to use some kind of queue to relieve those, uh, kind of like an off, like a worker background, uh, job that does the heavy lifting and- Yeah. ... so it doesn't clog the, the, the server. Yeah. You, you mentioned, you, you mentioned something really important. You mentioned heavy lifting, right? How do you, um... Yeah, let's suppose, uh, it's, it's a heavy lifting stuff. Mm-hmm. How do you proceed in that way? Um, so first off, uh, we need to see, uh...... like, we're gonna make sure that it's, it's, like, for example, we're trying to, uh, I don't know, make a video, uh, transform or something on the same route handler. So that's a no-no. We gotta create a worker. Um, and for that, what I have used in the past is, uh, basically you have a, a worker, uh, NodeJS- Okay. ... on the background, and it's listening, uh, to events. It can be from, from Redis, for example. So when the route hits, uh, that and it's time to do the heavy lifting, you just, uh, send, uh, kind of like an event that we, okay, we need to process this big file, this big task. Okay. And then just resolve the, the route with kind of like a progress, uh, or like a new job ID. And then the, the broker, the wor- the worker takes over and then he just do it on the background and can take whatever they want. Good. Awesome. Perfect. All right. Mm, do you know what's the difference between, uh, authorization and authentication? Mm, yeah. So I think, and I think they call it auth N and auth Z. So basically, au- uh, authentication is when you're trying to prove, uh, that you ha- uh, have wha- that you are a certain person. You can do this with your email and passwords, so that's, uh, authentication. You're proving yourself that you are this person with this email. Um, and authorization comes when this user, this actor tries to do actions on the applications, but we wanna authorize that this, uh, actor has permissions or access to certain resources on the app. So those are the distinctions. Good. Perfect. Uh, what are the, what are the ways, uh, we can store credentials of an authenticated user? Export? No, no. Store. Store. Store. Oh. So, what I've done in the past is that you basically have, uh, uh, two columns on a database which are email and then a password, which you hash. Um, so when the users try to authenticate, uh, they send their email and their password, you try to find the email, and then you match the password. There's a library called bcrypt, what I've used in the past to match those passwords if they match. Um, we can use JSON Web Tokens, um, to store that data, the, the- Mm-hmm. ... the data that the user, uh, provided and send it back. And then on each request, they can send back this token and we can verify it and see that it's valid, that it's not expired, uh... Okay. I think that's, uh... Awesome. Okay, good. Um, let's suppose we are on na- on a NodeJS backend, right? Uh. Mm-hmm. What would be the ways we could implement up-level caching? Up-level caching. Um, one of the ways, it could be in memory. (coughs) Uh, you need to manage that cache. When something updates, you need to update the cache, the memory. Uh, it can be... I never use it, but I know that there's a service called Memcached. You can cache whatever you want there. Yeah. Um, the other thing that I can think of is Redis which can serve as a, as a cache too. Okay. Awesome. All right. Uh, do you know what's the difference between imperative and declarative programming paradigms? Mm... Yes, but I, I've, I don't remember exactly how to explain it, but let me try. Um... And I, (laughs) I think I always write it, uh, declarative, but I don't know. I'm probably writing it declarative. Um... I don't remember. Okay. Good. Tha- that's fine. (laughs) Good. All right. Uh, do you know, what are, what are mocks? Yes. Okay. Um, so when you're trying to test an application, um, sometimes you wanna control the, the, the tests or the cases. So in those cases you use mocks to, uh, kind of force some service or some, uh, function that return what you want in order to test it. So you mock it. That's how you... Okay. Awesome. Okay. Good. (clears throat) Let me paste this piece of code here. Okay. Here we have this, uh, this is a pure function. It, it's not JavaScript or any language, it's just a pure function. Mm-hmm. Um, the thing with this, if you ch- if you see this pure function, it is receiving A and B. Uh, both of them as strings. Um, these functions, it's, it's doing a lot of stuff, right? It ma- it's making a lot of calculation. After those heavy calculations, it returns a value. It could be a string or, or a number or whatever. Mm-hmm. The problem with this function is that it's being called several times, many times from many different places inside the same application. The question is, how can we improve this function's performance? Um, we can use, uh, memoization. Uh, so basically which is kind of like- Yeah. ... uh, caching, uh, the value. Uh, so if you have the, the same arguments, you can... since it's pure, uh, you can assume that it will return the same, uh, value. You can, I think, memoize the function and the values so it doesn't, uh, take alone- Yeah. ... on all those places that it's being called. Yeah. Good. That's good. All right. Okay. Salvador, let me check, uh, if we miss, if we missed something. I think we covered the entire thing. Just give me one second. I gotta verify. Yes. Good. All right. Yeah, we are, we are, we are done. Good. Let me stop sharing right now. Mm-hmm. Um, let me stop...\", jobId=None, source='developer_assessment', diarization=Diarization(speaker0=\"Okay, Salvador. Uh, we are now recording. So the first question that I have for you is this, right? So I have here this get active users with cat function. This function, it, it's taking, uh, a set of users. So each user, it's, it's represented by an object. Each object, um, has name, is active, and has cat as properties, right? So the idea is that we can return the correct set of users, uh, but with these two conditions: the users needs, needs to be active and also has a cat. Those two conditions. Okay? Okay? Good. So you can- Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you should do it. Awesome. That was pretty fast. Great. Okay. Awesome. Let, let's keep going. All right. In th- in this case, we have this create new user. Uh, don't worry, you don't have to implement anything here. Uh, I just want you to tell me two things. The first one is, tell me what type or, or what kind of argument is that function taking? And the second thing is, explain the different syntaxes we have here. For example, this equal sign and this triple dots. Okay? Awesome. Good. All right. So let's keep, let's keep going. All right, uh, in this case, we have this person class, which is a very simple class, right? And in line number nine, what we are doing is trying to instantiate a new object of that class. For that reason, we are parsing this name and this age. The question is, what is missing inside the class to be able to instantiate this object properly? Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. Good. Awesome. All right. All right, in this, in this, uh, piece of code, what we have here is we are trying to, to, to create a, a sync functionality, right? Uh, if we run this code, uh, it will print start, finish, and timeout. That's wrong. The correct order- ... would, the correct order would be start, timeout, and finish. The idea is that you can fix the order, but you have to use promises. That's the only condition, using promises. Yeah, it will do it. Great. That's great. Cool. Okay. Let, let's keep going. Let's continue to the next line. Good. All right. In this case, we have this implementation, which is based on JavaScript objects, right? Uh, here we have this old object that has contact and email, and has this old email value assign- assigned to it. In line number 10, what we are trying to do is create a new object based on the old object. For that reason, we are spreading the old object inside it. In this line, what we are trying to do is change the new object contact email value to this new email value. Okay? The question is, what are these console logs printing and explain why? Okay, so you say both of them are going to print new email, right? Good. Awesome. That's good. All right, (clears throat) so okay, good. Mm, do you know what- what is an event emitter? And just give me an example of one of them or- or a library that we can use for- to use event emitters. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, uh- ... Do you know any- any example on- on the Node side? Okay. Okay, good. Um, do you know why was arrow functions introduced into JavaScript? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, awesome. Uh, in- in NodeJS, how do you debug a, an application in the- in development environment? Mm-hmm. Yeah, awesome. All right, uh, let me put this piece of code here again. Um, okay, here we have this- this- ... function, right? I just want you to tell me what happens when this express route handler gets- gets called. Okay. Okay, so what- what you're saying is that- is that this try-catch does not catch the error? Okay. Okay. Awesome. Uh, okay, good. (clears throat) So here's a NodeJS, uh, case. Um, we- we were requested to implement an endpoint that would return an, uh, stream of video content, right? The question is- ... how this can be implemented in NodeJS, and what APIs would you use to achieve this, and what things you need to- to watch out for?Mm-hmm. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right. Uh, okay, give me one second. My computer is lagging. (laughs) Oh, Jesus. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Here we go. So here we have this piece of code. Right? Mm, the question is, uh, can you write a synchronous code inside the uncaught exception even called back and explain why yes or not. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. You say you cannot write code, but you don't know the reason why. (laughs) Okay. Okay. It's good. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right, give me one second. I have to open something here. My computer is really, really... Okay, good. Here we go. Uh, here we have a, a graph, right? But that it represent, it's representing a, a, a traffic pattern in a server, right? Uh, the question is, mm, how do you provision a server to handle these arbitrary large peaks in that server? Yeah, that's, that's basically the, the, the traffic pattern. Um, uh, it's, it's, it's not relevant, the, the pace docks or edits, it's just, yeah, it has some arbitrary peaks on some actions, but on some other actions it's behaving like expected, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, you mentioned, you, you mentioned something really important. You mentioned heavy lifting, right? How do you, um... Yeah, let's suppose, uh, it's, it's a heavy lifting stuff. How do you proceed in that way? ... like, we're gonna make sure that it's, it's, like, for example, we're trying to, uh, I don't know, make a video, uh, transform or something on the same route handler. So that's a no-no. We gotta create a worker. Um, and for that, what I have used in the past is, uh, basically you have a, a worker, uh, NodeJS- Okay. Okay. Good. Awesome. Perfect. All right. Mm, do you know what's the difference between, uh, authorization and authentication? Good. Perfect. Uh, what are the, what are the ways, uh, we can store credentials of an authenticated user? No, no. Store. Store. Store. Mm-hmm. Okay. Awesome. Okay, good. Um, let's suppose we are on na- on a NodeJS backend, right? Uh. What would be the ways we could implement up-level caching? Yeah. Okay. Awesome. All right. Uh, do you know what's the difference between imperative and declarative programming paradigms? Okay. Good. Tha- that's fine. Good. All right. Uh, do you know, what are, what are mocks? Okay. Okay. Awesome. Okay. Good. (clears throat) Let me paste this piece of code here. Okay. Here we have this, uh, this is a pure function. It, it's not JavaScript or any language, it's just a pure function. Um, the thing with this, if you ch- if you see this pure function, it is receiving A and B. Uh, both of them as strings. Um, these functions, it's, it's doing a lot of stuff, right? It ma- it's making a lot of calculation. After those heavy calculations, it returns a value. It could be a string or, or a number or whatever. The problem with this function is that it's being called several times, many times from many different places inside the same application. The question is, how can we improve this function's performance? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. That's good. All right. Okay. Salvador, let me check, uh, if we miss, if we missed something. I think we covered the entire thing. Just give me one second. I gotta verify. Good. All right. Yeah, we are, we are, we are done. Good. Let me stop sharing right now. Mm-hmm. Um, let me stop...\", speaker1=\"Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. All right. So (clears throat) this, uh, we're gonna use the filter, uh, method from the array. Uh, so we're gonna get a user and we're gonna filter only the ones that is active and user as cat. So I think this should do it. Okay. Um, so this function is taking an object as an argument, and it's, uh, destructuring. Um, and it's using this equals some name here, this is, uh, uh, a default value. If name is undefined, it will assign this, uh, uh, value to that property, and active that, that can be, uh, undefined. We're n- we're not doing anything with this. And this is spreading the rest of the properties of the object on the argument. Uh, it's missing the constructor for this class, um, on JavaScript you need to provide this constructor function- ... to initialize it. Otherwise, it will use the default one that you have in there, which is an empty string and a H as zero. Yeah. Okay. Uh, so the first thing is that we need to return a promise in here, uh, let's just do... We're gonna return new promise, and if I'm not mistaken, there's this reject and resolve. Um, and then console log, and then we gotta resolve it. I think this, this, this is going to work now. If you, if you want start, timeout, and finish. (clears throat) Mm-hmm. Um, both are going to print new email, um, I think, um, i- it does because the objects get copied by reference, um, in JavaScript.So this ob- this o- object will copy, uh, this one but then the contact, it will still be the same 'cause it's another object. So I think it will print new email, um, but I might say I'm not completely sure because of this nested object, but I'm pretty sure it will keep the reference to this object. Yeah. That's my answer, (laughs) Yeah, basically they're just, um, they're like, uh, an object that emit events (laughs) that's kind of, like, redundant, but it basically works that you attach listeners to this emitter, um, and once the emitter sends an event, all those attached listeners will get fired with the event. Um, we can find those on the DOM, for example, when you attach, uh, an event listener to a HTML button, you can- ... use the add event listener multiple times, and that's- that's kind of like a- an emitter. So when you- ... click it, for example, you can- ... receive that event. Um, I think, uh, Node has a- a- a package built in it called Emitter. I- I don't remember exactly, I haven't used it, uh, in a long time. But- but yeah, they're- they- they- they are packages on NPM, uh, that you can use also, uh, to handle event emitters. Um, if I can remember, it was because, um, one thing was the- the scope of the, this- ... uh, keyword on JavaScript. So every time you- ... created a function, uh, you were changing the scope of the this, uh, keyword. So with, uh, fat arrows, uh, it doesn't change the context, so- ... it keeps the- the parent function context, so that was one. And I think it... because one-liner functions (laughs) look, uh, a lot better. (laughs) Uh, you create it, uh, you start the application in debug mode, and you can connect to it through Chrome, uh- ... to the- the debugger, the Node debugger basically, and you can see it kind of like it was JavaScript on the web, uh, but it's through Chrome. Mm-hmm. Yeah, um, so line eight, you declare a content route from the express app, and then you try to read the file, and that is on the same directory of that file, and then you- ... append the content, that JSON, so you're trying to read content JSON on the same directory, basically. Um, once you get the data, uh, uh, it runs code that throws an error, so that's an- that's not good. I think we need to check if there is an error, um, present, then we throw the error, and if it's not, uh, we can send the data on the response object. The other thing is that this try-catch is not going to do, I think, a lot, because you're using the callback, uh, mode for the filesystem module. Um, but yeah, it's basically trying to send the content JSON, uh, content back to the client. No, it will not catch the error- ... if an error occur. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh, the first thing is, to watch out is for this header. I think all of the browsers in this header when they try to access media on the server, which is the range header, so we need to- ... watch for that. After we have that one, um, uh, we need to... Basically they ask us for a range of bytes on a, on a file. So when we read, we, we need to parse that range and we need to figure out, uh, the file size and, and then we need to read that file but at specific, at the specific range that the browser is asking for, so we don't read the whole file. So it goes into how you call it, like, uh, like in a streaming mode. We gotta handle the correct HTTP codes, which is partial content, if I, uh, remember correctly. Uh, so we wanna keep the connection open there. Um, and I think, yeah, there's a couple of other headers that we need to send back, which I don't remember exactly, but basically you need to specify, uh- ... what's the size of the file. That kind of stuff. Hmm. Damn, that's a good one. Um, I don't think you can. Uh, I will assume because that's just the end of the... well, when it's a, an exception. I would assume not, but I'm not exactly why not. I haven't encountered this in the past, so, but I will say no, you cannot. Um, I've never seen it before. (laughs) Um, but yeah, I, I don't know exactly why not. And I, I'm probably wrong, but I will go with that one. Yeah, I don't, I don't- ... think you can, you should write asynchronous code on this function. Uh, I don't know, probably can generate more codes. Um, more, more errors, uh, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. Mm-hmm. Hmm, what's, what does it say? Pace dock and then edit? Um, I will... There's probably some, uh, database, right? Or a lot of... uh, oh, it's mostly certain that it has to either with the database rights and reads that, that, uh, route it's handling or if it's that I will s- I will, I will go with trying to optimize the query. Um... The other thing that I can think of, it's probably, um, third party appli- uh, apps that we're using that they can be, uh, I don't know, taking a lot of time to resolve. And the last thing I can, can, that I will debug, uh, would be that if we're, uh, making expensive tasks on that controller, and then we need to use some kind of queue to relieve those, uh, kind of like an off, like a worker background, uh, job that does the heavy lifting and- ... so it doesn't clog the, the, the server. Mm-hmm. Um, so first off, uh, we need to see, uh...... on the background, and it's listening, uh, to events. It can be from, from Redis, for example. So when the route hits, uh, that and it's time to do the heavy lifting, you just, uh, send, uh, kind of like an event that we, okay, we need to process this big file, this big task. And then just resolve the, the route with kind of like a progress, uh, or like a new job ID. And then the, the broker, the wor- the worker takes over and then he just do it on the background and can take whatever they want. Mm, yeah. So I think, and I think they call it auth N and auth Z. So basically, au- uh, authentication is when you're trying to prove, uh, that you ha- uh, have wha- that you are a certain person. You can do this with your email and passwords, so that's, uh, authentication. You're proving yourself that you are this person with this email. Um, and authorization comes when this user, this actor tries to do actions on the applications, but we wanna authorize that this, uh, actor has permissions or access to certain resources on the app. So those are the distinctions. Export? Oh. So, what I've done in the past is that you basically have, uh, uh, two columns on a database which are email and then a password, which you hash. Um, so when the users try to authenticate, uh, they send their email and their password, you try to find the email, and then you match the password. There's a library called bcrypt, what I've used in the past to match those passwords if they match. Um, we can use JSON Web Tokens, um, to store that data, the, the- ... the data that the user, uh, provided and send it back. And then on each request, they can send back this token and we can verify it and see that it's valid, that it's not expired, uh... I think that's, uh... Mm-hmm. Up-level caching. Um, one of the ways, it could be in memory. (coughs) Uh, you need to manage that cache. When something updates, you need to update the cache, the memory. Uh, it can be... I never use it, but I know that there's a service called Memcached. You can cache whatever you want there. Um, the other thing that I can think of is Redis which can serve as a, as a cache too. Mm... Yes, but I, I've, I don't remember exactly how to explain it, but let me try. Um... And I, (laughs) I think I always write it, uh, declarative, but I don't know. I'm probably writing it declarative. Um... I don't remember. (laughs) Yes. Um, so when you're trying to test an application, um, sometimes you wanna control the, the, the tests or the cases. So in those cases you use mocks to, uh, kind of force some service or some, uh, function that return what you want in order to test it. So you mock it. That's how you... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um, we can use, uh, memoization. Uh, so basically which is kind of like- ... uh, caching, uh, the value. Uh, so if you have the, the same arguments, you can... since it's pure, uh, you can assume that it will return the same, uh, value. You can, I think, memoize the function and the values so it doesn't, uh, take alone- ... on all those places that it's being called. Yes. \"), summary=\"The interview focused on assessing Salvador's technical knowledge and problem-solving skills relevant to a software engineering role, particularly in JavaScript and Node.js. The discussion covered core concepts such as array filtering, object destructuring, and default parameters, with explanations of syntax like the spread operator and default values. Salvador demonstrated understanding of class instantiation, noting the necessity of constructors in JavaScript classes. The candidate showed familiarity with asynchronous programming, specifically promises, and explained how to correct promise order in code. They discussed object reference behavior in JavaScript, particularly with nested objects, and explained event emitters, mentioning Node.js's built-in 'events' module and general event-driven architecture. The candidate articulated the purpose of arrow functions, emphasizing scope preservation of 'this', and described debugging Node.js applications via Chrome DevTools. They explained handling file content in Express routes, noting limitations of try-catch with callback-based APIs. Salvador described implementing video streaming with range headers, byte-range requests, and partial content responses, highlighting key HTTP headers and status codes. They discussed server provisioning strategies for traffic peaks, including database query optimization, background workers, and queues for heavy tasks. The candidate distinguished between authentication (identity verification) and authorization (permission granting), and described credential storage methods such as hashed passwords with bcrypt and JWT tokens. They mentioned in-memory caching, Redis, and Memcached for cache strategies, and briefly differentiated imperative versus declarative paradigms. Mocks were explained as test doubles to control test environments. Lastly, Salvador suggested memoization to optimize heavy, repeatedly called pure functions, emphasizing caching results based on input arguments. \\n\\nGlossary: JavaScript, Node.js, promises, class, constructor, spread operator, default parameters, object reference, event emitter, arrow functions,\", description=None, developerId='0206eb72-32a9-46cc-a628-f834ff80009b'))\n",

So here we have this piece of code. Right? Mm, the question is, uh, can you write a synchronous code inside the uncaught exception even called back and explain why yes or not. Hmm. Damn, that's a good one. Um, I don't think you can. Uh, I will assume because that's just the end of the... well, when it's a, an exception. Mm-hmm. I would assume not, but I'm not exactly why not. I haven't encountered this in the past, so, but I will say no, you cannot. Um, I've never seen it before. (laughs) Okay. Um, but yeah, I, I don't know exactly why not. And I, I'm probably wrong, but I will go with that one. Okay. You say you cannot write code, but you don't know the reason why. (laughs) Yeah, I don't, I don't- Okay. ... think you can, you should write asynchronous code on this function. Uh, I don't know, probably can generate more codes. Um, more, more errors, uh, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. Okay. It's good. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right, give me one second. I have to open something here. My computer is really, really... Okay, good. Here we go. Uh, here we have a, a graph, right? But that it represent, it's representing a, a, a traffic pattern in a server, right? Mm-hmm. Uh, the question is, mm, how do you provision a server to handle these arbitrary large peaks in that server? Hmm, what's, what does it say? Pace dock and then edit? Yeah, that's, that's basically the, the, the traffic pattern. Um, uh, it's, it's, it's not relevant, the, the pace docks or edits, it's just, yeah, it has some arbitrary peaks on some actions, but on some other actions it's behaving like expected, right? Um, I will... There's probably some, uh, database, right? Or a lot of... uh, oh, it's mostly certain that it has to either with the database rights and reads that, that, uh, route it's handling or if it's that I will s- I will, I will go with trying to optimize the query. Um... Okay. The other thing that I can think of, it's probably, um, third party appli- uh, apps that we're using that they can be, uh, I don't know, taking a lot of time to resolve. Yeah. And the last thing I can, can, that I will debug, uh, would be that if we're, uh, making expensive tasks on that controller, and then we need to use some kind of queue to relieve those, uh, kind of like an off, like a worker background, uh, job that does the heavy lifting and- Yeah. ... so it doesn't clog the, the, the server. Yeah. You, you mentioned, you, you mentioned something really important. You mentioned heavy lifting, right? How do you, um... Yeah, let's suppose, uh, it's, it's a heavy lifting stuff. Mm-hmm. How do you proceed in that way? Um, so first off, uh, we need to see, uh...... like, we're gonna make sure that it's, it's, like, for example, we're trying to, uh, I don't know, make a video, uh, transform or something on the same route handler. So that's a no-no. We gotta create a worker. Um, and for that, what I have used in the past is, uh, basically you have a, a worker, uh, NodeJS- Okay. ... on the background, and it's listening, uh, to events. It can be from, from Redis, for example. So when the route hits, uh, that and it's time to do the heavy lifting, you just, uh, send, uh, kind of like an event that we, okay, we need to process this big file, this big task. Okay. And then just resolve the, the route with kind of like a progress, uh, or like a new job ID. And then the, the broker, the wor- the worker takes over and then he just do it on the background and can take whatever they want. Good. Awesome. Perfect. All right. Mm, do you know what's the difference between, uh, authorization and authentication? Mm, yeah. So I think, and I think they call it auth N and auth Z. So basically, au- uh, authentication is when you're trying to prove, uh, that you ha- uh, have wha- that you are a certain person. You can do this with your email and passwords, so that's, uh, authentication. You're proving yourself that you are this person with this email. Um, and authorization comes when this user, this actor tries to do actions on the applications, but we wanna authorize that this, uh, actor has permissions or access to certain resources on the app. So those are the distinctions. Good. Perfect. Uh, what are the, what are the ways, uh, we can store credentials of an authenticated user? Export? No, no. Store. Store. Store. Oh. So, what I've done in the past is that you basically have, uh, uh, two columns on a database which are email and then a password, which you hash. Um, so when the users try to authenticate, uh, they send their email and their password, you try to find the email, and then you match the password. There's a library called bcrypt, what I've used in the past to match those passwords if they match. Um, we can use JSON Web Tokens, um, to store that data, the, the- Mm-hmm. ... the data that the user, uh, provided and send it back. And then on each request, they can send back this token and we can verify it and see that it's valid, that it's not expired, uh... Okay. I think that's, uh... Awesome. Okay, good. Um, let's suppose we are on na- on a NodeJS backend, right? Uh. Mm-hmm. What would be the ways we could implement up-level caching? Up-level caching. Um, one of the ways, it could be in memory. (coughs) Uh, you need to manage that cache. When something updates, you need to update the cache, the memory. Uh, it can be... I never use it, but I know that there's a service called Memcached. You can cache whatever you want there. Yeah. Um, the other thing that I can think of is Redis which can serve as a, as a cache too. Okay. Awesome. All right. Uh, do you know what's the difference between imperative and declarative programming paradigms? Mm... Yes, but I, I've, I don't remember exactly how to explain it, but let me try. Um... And I, (laughs) I think I always write it, uh, declarative, but I don't know. I'm probably writing it declarative. Um... I don't remember. Okay. Good. Tha- that's fine. (laughs) Good. All right. Uh, do you know, what are, what are mocks? Yes. Okay. Um, so when you're trying to test an application, um, sometimes you wanna control the, the, the tests or the cases. So in those cases you use mocks to, uh, kind of force some service or some, uh, function that return what you want in order to test it. So you mock it. That's how you... Okay. Awesome. Okay. Good. (clears throat) Let me paste this piece of code here. Okay. Here we have this, uh, this is a pure function. It, it's not JavaScript or any language, it's just a pure function. Mm-hmm. Um, the thing with this, if you ch- if you see this pure function, it is receiving A and B. Uh, both of them as strings. Um, these functions, it's, it's doing a lot of stuff, right? It ma- it's making a lot of calculation. After those heavy calculations, it returns a value. It could be a string or, or a number or whatever. Mm-hmm. The problem with this function is that it's being called several times, many times from many different places inside the same application. The question is, how can we improve this function's performance? Um, we can use, uh, memoization. Uh, so basically which is kind of like- Yeah. ... uh, caching, uh, the value. Uh, so if you have the, the same arguments, you can... since it's pure, uh, you can assume that it will return the same, uh, value. You can, I think, memoize the function and the values so it doesn't, uh, take alone- Yeah. ... on all those places that it's being called. Yeah. Good. That's good. All right. Okay. Salvador, let me check, uh, if we miss, if we missed something. I think we covered the entire thing. Just give me one second. I gotta verify. Yes. Good. All right. Yeah, we are, we are, we are done. Good. Let me stop sharing right now. Mm-hmm. Um, let me stop...\", 'jobId': None, 'source': 'developer_assessment', 'diarization': {'speaker0': \"Okay, Salvador. Uh, we are now recording. So the first question that I have for you is this, right? So I have here this get active users with cat function. This function, it, it's taking, uh, a set of users. So each user, it's, it's represented by an object. Each object, um, has name, is active, and has cat as properties, right? So the idea is that we can return the correct set of users, uh, but with these two conditions: the users needs, needs to be active and also has a cat. Those two conditions. Okay? Okay? Good. So you can- Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you should do it. Awesome. That was pretty fast. Great. Okay. Awesome. Let, let's keep going. All right. In th- in this case, we have this create new user. Uh, don't worry, you don't have to implement anything here. Uh, I just want you to tell me two things. The first one is, tell me what type or, or what kind of argument is that function taking? And the second thing is, explain the different syntaxes we have here. For example, this equal sign and this triple dots. Okay? Awesome. Good. All right. So let's keep, let's keep going. All right, uh, in this case, we have this person class, which is a very simple class, right? And in line number nine, what we are doing is trying to instantiate a new object of that class. For that reason, we are parsing this name and this age. The question is, what is missing inside the class to be able to instantiate this object properly? Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. Good. Awesome. All right. All right, in this, in this, uh, piece of code, what we have here is we are trying to, to, to create a, a sync functionality, right? Uh, if we run this code, uh, it will print start, finish, and timeout. That's wrong. The correct order- ... would, the correct order would be start, timeout, and finish. The idea is that you can fix the order, but you have to use promises. That's the only condition, using promises. Yeah, it will do it. Great. That's great. Cool. Okay. Let, let's keep going. Let's continue to the next line. Good. All right. In this case, we have this implementation, which is based on JavaScript objects, right? Uh, here we have this old object that has contact and email, and has this old email value assign- assigned to it. In line number 10, what we are trying to do is create a new object based on the old object. For that reason, we are spreading the old object inside it. In this line, what we are trying to do is change the new object contact email value to this new email value. Okay? The question is, what are these console logs printing and explain why? Okay, so you say both of them are going to print new email, right? Good. Awesome. That's good. All right, (clears throat) so okay, good. Mm, do you know what- what is an event emitter? And just give me an example of one of them or- or a library that we can use for- to use event emitters. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, uh- ... Do you know any- any example on- on the Node side? Okay. Okay, good. Um, do you know why was arrow functions introduced into JavaScript? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, awesome. Uh, in- in NodeJS, how do you debug a, an application in the- in development environment? Mm-hmm. Yeah, awesome. All right, uh, let me put this piece of code here again. Um, okay, here we have this- this- ... function, right? I just want you to tell me what happens when this express route handler gets- gets called. Okay. Okay, so what- what you're saying is that- is that this try-catch does not catch the error? Okay. Okay. Awesome. Uh, okay, good. (clears throat) So here's a NodeJS, uh, case. Um, we- we were requested to implement an endpoint that would return an, uh, stream of video content, right? The question is- ... how this can be implemented in NodeJS, and what APIs would you use to achieve this, and what things you need to- to watch out for?Mm-hmm. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right. Uh, okay, give me one second. My computer is lagging. (laughs) Oh, Jesus. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Here we go. So here we have this piece of code. Right? Mm, the question is, uh, can you write a synchronous code inside the uncaught exception even called back and explain why yes or not. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. You say you cannot write code, but you don't know the reason why. (laughs) Okay. Okay. It's good. Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. All right, give me one second. I have to open something here. My computer is really, really... Okay, good. Here we go. Uh, here we have a, a graph, right? But that it represent, it's representing a, a, a traffic pattern in a server, right? Uh, the question is, mm, how do you provision a server to handle these arbitrary large peaks in that server? Yeah, that's, that's basically the, the, the traffic pattern. Um, uh, it's, it's, it's not relevant, the, the pace docks or edits, it's just, yeah, it has some arbitrary peaks on some actions, but on some other actions it's behaving like expected, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, you mentioned, you, you mentioned something really important. You mentioned heavy lifting, right? How do you, um... Yeah, let's suppose, uh, it's, it's a heavy lifting stuff. How do you proceed in that way? ... like, we're gonna make sure that it's, it's, like, for example, we're trying to, uh, I don't know, make a video, uh, transform or something on the same route handler.

Um, let me stop...\", 'speaker1': \"Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. All right. So (clears throat) this, uh, we're gonna use the filter, uh, method from the array. Uh, so we're gonna get a user and we're gonna filter only the ones that is active and user as cat. So I think this should do it. Okay. Um, so this function is taking an object as an argument, and it's, uh, destructuring. Um, and it's using this equals some name here, this is, uh, uh, a default value. If name is undefined, it will assign this, uh, uh, value to that property, and active that, that can be, uh, undefined. We're n- we're not doing anything with this. And this is spreading the rest of the properties of the object on the argument. Uh, it's missing the constructor for this class, um, on JavaScript you need to provide this constructor function- ... to initialize it. Otherwise, it will use the default one that you have in there, which is an empty string and a H as zero. Yeah. Okay. Uh, so the first thing is that we need to return a promise in here, uh, let's just do... We're gonna return new promise, and if I'm not mistaken, there's this reject and resolve. Um, and then console log, and then we gotta resolve it. I think this, this, this is going to work now. If you, if you want start, timeout, and finish. (clears throat) Mm-hmm. Um, both are going to print new email, um, I think, um, i- it does because the objects get copied by reference, um, in JavaScript.So this ob- this o- object will copy, uh, this one but then the contact, it will still be the same 'cause it's another object. So I think it will print new email, um, but I might say I'm not completely sure because of this nested object, but I'm pretty sure it will keep the reference to this object. Yeah. That's my answer, (laughs) Yeah, basically they're just, um, they're like, uh, an object that emit events (laughs) that's kind of, like, redundant, but it basically works that you attach listeners to this emitter, um, and once the emitter sends an event, all those attached listeners will get fired with the event. Um, we can find those on the DOM, for example, when you attach, uh, an event listener to a HTML button, you can- ... use the add event listener multiple times, and that's- that's kind of like a- an emitter. So when you- ... click it, for example, you can- ... receive that event. Um, I think, uh, Node has a- a- a package built in it called Emitter. I- I don't remember exactly, I haven't used it, uh, in a long time. But- but yeah, they're- they- they- they are packages on NPM, uh, that you can use also, uh, to handle event emitters. Um, if I can remember, it was because, um, one thing was the- the scope of the, this- ... uh, keyword on JavaScript. So every time you- ... created a function, uh, you were changing the scope of the this, uh, keyword. So with, uh, fat arrows, uh, it doesn't change the context, so- ... it keeps the- the parent function context, so that was one. And I think it... because one-liner functions (laughs) look, uh, a lot better. (laughs) Uh, you create it, uh, you start the application in debug mode, and you can connect to it through Chrome, uh- ... to the- the debugger, the Node debugger basically, and you can see it kind of like it was JavaScript on the web, uh, but it's through Chrome. Mm-hmm. Yeah, um, so line eight, you declare a content route from the express app, and then you try to read the file, and that is on the same directory of that file, and then you- ... append the content, that JSON, so you're trying to read content JSON on the same directory, basically. Um, once you get the data, uh, uh, it runs code that throws an error, so that's an- that's not good. I think we need to check if there is an error, um, present, then we throw the error, and if it's not, uh, we can send the data on the response object. The other thing is that this try-catch is not going to do, I think, a lot, because you're using the callback, uh, mode for the filesystem module. Um, but yeah, it's basically trying to send the content JSON, uh, content back to the client. No, it will not catch the error- ... if an error occur. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh, the first thing is, to watch out is for this header. I think all of the browsers in this header when they try to access media on the server, which is the range header, so we need to- ... watch for that. After we have that one, um, uh, we need to... Basically they ask us for a range of bytes on a, on a file. So when we read, we, we need to parse that range and we need to figure out, uh, the file size and, and then we need to read that file but at specific, at the specific range that the browser is asking for, so we don't read the whole file. So it goes into how you call it, like, uh, like in a streaming mode. We gotta handle the correct HTTP codes, which is partial content, if I, uh, remember correctly. Uh, so we wanna keep the connection open there. Um, and I think, yeah, there's a couple of other headers that we need to send back, which I don't remember exactly, but basically you need to specify, uh- ... what's the size of the file. That kind of stuff. Hmm. Damn, that's a good one. Um, I don't think you can. Uh, I will assume because that's just the end of the... well, when it's a, an exception. I would assume not, but I'm not exactly why not. I haven't encountered this in the past, so, but I will say no, you cannot. Um, I've never seen it before. (laughs) Um, but yeah, I, I don't know exactly why not. And I, I'm probably wrong, but I will go with that one. Yeah, I don't, I don't- ... think you can, you should write asynchronous code on this function. Uh, I don't know, probably can generate more codes. Um, more, more errors, uh, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. Mm-hmm. Hmm, what's, what does it say? Pace dock and then edit? Um, I will... There's probably some, uh, database, right? Or a lot of... uh, oh, it's mostly certain that it has to either with the database rights and reads that, that, uh, route it's handling or if it's that I will s- I will, I will go with trying to optimize the query. Um... The other thing that I can think of, it's probably, um, third party appli- uh, apps that we're using that they can be, uh, I don't know, taking a lot of time to resolve.

So basically, au- uh, authentication is when you're trying to prove, uh, that you ha- uh, have wha- that you are a certain person. You can do this with your email and passwords, so that's, uh, authentication. You're proving yourself that you are this person with this email. Um, and authorization comes when this user, this actor tries to do actions on the applications, but we wanna authorize that this, uh, actor has permissions or access to certain resources on the app. So those are the distinctions.

Um, so when the users try to authenticate, uh, they send their email and their password, you try to find the email, and then you match the password.

And then on each request, they can send back this token and we can verify it and see that it's valid, that it's not expired, uh... I think that's, uh... Mm-hmm. Up-level caching. Um, one of the ways, it could be in memory. (coughs) Uh, you need to manage that cache. When something updates, you need to update the cache, the memory. Uh, it can be... I never use it, but I know that there's a service called Memcached. You can cache whatever you want there. Um, the other thing that I can think of is Redis which can serve as a, as a cache too. Mm... Yes, but I, I've, I don't remember exactly how to explain it, but let me try. Um... And I, (laughs) I think I always write it, uh, declarative, but I don't know. I'm probably writing it declarative. Um... I don't remember. (laughs) Yes. Um, so when you're trying to test an application, um, sometimes you wanna control the, the, the tests or the cases. So in those cases you use mocks to, uh, kind of force some service or some, uh, function that return what you want in order to test it. So you mock it. That's how you... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um, we can use, uh, memoization. Uh, so basically which is kind of like- ... uh, caching, uh, the value. Uh, so if you have the, the same arguments, you can... since it's pure, uh, you can assume that it will return the same, uh, value. You can, I think, memoize the function and the values so it doesn't, uh, take alone- ... on all those places that it's being called. Yes. \"}, 'summary': \"The interview focused on assessing Salvador's technical knowledge and problem-solving skills relevant to a software engineering role, particularly in JavaScript and Node.js. The discussion covered core concepts such as array filtering, object destructuring, and default parameters, with explanations of syntax like the spread operator and default values. Salvador demonstrated understanding of class instantiation, noting the necessity of constructors in JavaScript classes. The candidate showed familiarity with asynchronous programming, specifically promises, and explained how to correct promise order in code. They discussed object reference behavior in JavaScript, particularly with nested objects, and explained event emitters, mentioning Node.js's built-in 'events' module and general event-driven architecture. The candidate articulated the purpose of arrow functions, emphasizing scope preservation of 'this', and described debugging Node.js applications via Chrome DevTools. They explained handling file content in Express routes, noting limitations of try-catch with callback-based APIs. Salvador described implementing video streaming with range headers, byte-range requests, and partial content responses, highlighting key HTTP headers and status codes. They discussed server provisioning strategies for traffic peaks, including database query optimization, background workers, and queues for heavy tasks. The candidate distinguished between authentication (identity verification) and authorization (permission granting), and described credential storage methods such as hashed passwords with bcrypt and JWT tokens. They mentioned in-memory caching, Redis, and Memcached for cache strategies, and briefly differentiated imperative versus declarative paradigms. Mocks were explained as test doubles to control test environments. Lastly, Salvador suggested memoization to optimize heavy, repeatedly called pure functions, emphasizing caching results based on input arguments. \\n\\nGlossary: JavaScript, Node.js, promises, class, constructor, spread operator, default parameters, object reference, event emitter, arrow functions,\", 'description': None, 'developerId': '0206eb72-32a9-46cc-a628-f834ff80009b'}}}\n"
